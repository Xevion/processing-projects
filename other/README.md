## About

Other sketches without any specific purpose. If enough fit into a specific category, a new category could be created and they'll be moved. Includes stuff like jokes, tests of the processing.py library, or interesting data structures.

## Projects

- **Chaser** - A test demonstrating easing equations.

- **Clusters** - A test of a simple clusterization algorithm.

- **DVD Logo** - A fun little sketch displaying the iconic bouncing DVD Logo. May need a little more work to better visualize true-to-heart.

- **DynamicLines** - A very simple line drawing application.

- **FlipFlopChain** - A simple project displaying how one would count in binary.

- **Graph-Theory** - A simple project closely mimicing the particle.js library.

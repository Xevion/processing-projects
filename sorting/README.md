# sorting

## About

Sketches that visualize sorting algorithms as they progress.

## Sketches

- **cocktail_shaker_line** - Sorting of a line using the cocktail shaker algorithm (double bouble sort I believe). Needs reworking as the colors and movement of the line is not as expected (colors shift, movement doesn't properly correlate).

- **insertion_sort_line** - Sorting of a line using the insertion sort algorithm.

- **ColorSort** - Spherical rainbow sorted using simple Bubblesort (?) algorithm. Probably the sketch I am most proud of in the sorting category, as the sphere representation was difficult to create ande model.

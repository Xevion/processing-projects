# mazes

## About

Projects that generate mazes using various algorithms. Developed primarily in 2018-2019. All of these are generating simple square mazes, just using different algorithms and occaisionally a little twist.

## Sketches

- **MazeGenV2** Second maze generation attempt. First *working* maze implementation. Recursive Backtracker algorithm.

- **MazeGenSolve** - Maze gen with a completed path shown after. Recursive Backtracker algorithm for Generation, A* algorithm for pathfinding (very similar in theory).

- **MazeGenBinaryTree** - Binary Tree algorithm

- **MazeGenGrowingTree** - Growing Tree algorithm

- **MazeGenKruskalTree** - Kruskal Tree algorithm

- **MazeGenSidewinder** - Sidewinder algorithm. A little bit buggy at the end, but properly implemented none the less.

- **MazeClustersCreator** - Not so much a maze as a interesting side-project when developing my maze generators. Somewhat buggy.

# processing-projects

## About

This repository holds a collection of visually compelling projects built primarily in [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/), otherwise built in the regular Java [Processing](https://processing.org/) system.

These projects were created mostly for myself, but after amassing so many, I've been interested in posting a collection of them. A good mass aren't posted since they weren't working or were testing something less visual, but the working ones are all posted.

Once I have a moment, I intend to add GIFs showing them in action (as currently this repository is very boring).

A small reminder about everything in this repository: these are all rendering real-time and built using Python to take a peek through the keyhole of visual algorithms. They aren't really intended to be a perfect reflection of Python nor my abilities.

Regardless, I hope you enjoy viewing them, I certainly enjoyed creating and learning about them during school and after hours.

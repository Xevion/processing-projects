# processing-projects

## About

This repository holds a collection of visually compelling projects built primarily in [Processing.py](https://py.processing.org/), otherwise built in the regular Java [Processing](https://processing.org/) system.

These projects were created mostly for myself, but after amassing so many, I've been interested in posting a collection of them. A good mass aren't posted since they weren't working or were testing something less visual, but the working ones are all posted.

Once I have a moment, I intend to add GIFs showing them in action (as currently this repository is very boring).
